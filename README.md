The aim of this project is to create a microservice that returns a JASON payload, and also performs continuous integration(CI) through Github actions as well as deploy change (CD) through Fast API. I used the example of getting youtube recommendation for data scientist interview preparation. 




 
Steps: 
 
1. Create a Microservice that returns a JSON payload and performs a Data Engineering related task
2. Push tested source code to Github and perform Continuous Integration with Github Actions (or similar SaaS Build service)
3. Configure Build Server to Deploy Changes on build (Continuous Delivery)
4. Create realistic API


* Install youtubesearchpython package: : `pip install youtubesearchpython`
