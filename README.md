 build continuous delivery of FastAPI 
 
 steps: 
 
1. Create a Microservice that returns a JSON payload and performs a Data Engineering related task
2. Push tested source code to Github and perform Continuous Integration with Github Actions (or similar SaaS Build service)
3. Configure Build Server to Deploy Changes on build (Continuous Delivery)
